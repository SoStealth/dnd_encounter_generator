How the software works:
The user will insert his D&D party, with classes and stats.
At the start of the simulation, the software will create a random group of monsters partially based on CR. It will then simulate 
some battles between party and monsters and draw a value based on the result of the battles. If this value matches the conditions for a
"balanced encounter", it will output the monster data via file. Else, it will modify the monster group (adding or removing members or
changing the type of monsters) to try and balance the value. If after N tries the software isn't able to create a balanced encounter it
will return the closest result.

About the characters:
For now, users will be able to only insert classes and stats for the characters, not equipment or spells. This way, the simulation will be
based on standard characters, so that during the actual game people who gained stronger items or spells will be advantaged, as it should be.
Anyway there is the possibility of creating and adding personal gear and magic, even tho not everything has been included yet (for example,
only damage or heal spells are available right now, while buffing or other types of spells can't be created). Further versions of this
software may include more options of character customization.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How the combat works:
The combat, as of now, will consist in making characters and monster act randomly and in a random sequence. Every character and monster has
his own pattern. At the end of the battle, a value will be generated. Then, a second simulation will start, generating a second value. This
will repeat until N simulations (a higher N value means more precision while a lower means faster times). At the end, an average of all the
N values will be calculated and that will represent the "balance value" of the encounter. Based on that, the monster group will be modified
and the simulation will restart, or the output file will be created with the results.
Each combat will also create a log file with every single combat step and throw result, so that the master can verify if the encounter is
suited for his party.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional features:
There is also the possibility of manually creating a group of monsters and launch the simulation, which will return the balance results of
that encounter, so that the dungeon master can create personalized group of monsters and see a simple simulation of the combat between his
party and the encounter
